# **Dotocracy**

## **Project description**

Dotocracy is the evolution of democracy towards technology. Our platform uses blockchain to allow voting where consensus, transparency and decentralization rule. Running on top of Polkadot it can be easily integrated with different EVM compatible parachains, such as Moonbeam and Astar.

### **Democracy and consensus today's problems**

The main problems with votings with large numbers of voters are:

**Low voter turnout**

In many cases, under an optimistic scenario, the participation of only 60% of the electoral roll or qualified voters is expected. This is a very low participation rate, which can be increased by the use of a reliable and secure voting system that allows voters to vote from any location and device in which they can give proof of identity.

**Risk of fraud**

The risk of fraud under the current voting system is unnecessarily high. As people are involved and they can be persuade to manipulate either the votes and the people that are voting.

**Vote couting procedure**

The current vote counting system has many vulnerabilities, from "innocent" human error to "mistakes" made in order to tamper with the results. Not to mention that it is expensive and timeconsuming.

**High costs and exorbitant times**

As the system is currently implemented, it is very expensive and it takes a lot of time to count the votes. This is a problem that can be solved by using a blockchain-based voting system. It is not only a matter of time and money, but also of security. As more time pases between the voting and the results, the more unseccure the results are. This is because the results can be manipulated.

### **Why Dotocracy?**

Dotocracy is a blockchain-based voting system that solves the problems of the current voting system. It is a decentralized and secure system that allows voters to vote from any location and device in which they can give proof of identity. It is also a fast and cheap system that allows the counting of votes in real time.

**Low voter turnout can be increased**

Dotocracy allows voters to vote from any location and device in which they can give proof of identity. This allows the participation of voters that are not able to go to the voting booth. This is a very important feature that can increase the voter turnout.

**Risk of fraud can be reduced**

Using Dotocracy, fraud is not possible. As the system is blockchain-based, the results are immutable and every vote pass through a consensus algorithm that guarantees its integrity.

**Vote counting faster and cheaper**

Using Dotocracy, the vote counting procedure is faster and cheaper. This is because every vote is counted in real time and the results are immutable. This means that the results are available as soon as the voting is closed and they can not be tampered.

### **Why Polkadot?**

Polkadot is a Substrate-based blockchain that allows the creation of multiple parachains to be connected to the main chain. Substrate is a framework that allows the creation of blockchains using a modular approach. It uses Rust programming language and it is very secure. It is also very fast and scalable. Fees in polkadot are very low and the TPS is very high. This makes it a perfect environment to be used as a base for a voting system.

**Moonbeam**

Is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot. This means that contracts are written in Solidity and they can be deployed to the Moonbeam network. This is a very important feature because it allows the use of existing smart contracts to be used in the Dotocracy voting system.

**Astar**

The network supports the building of dApps with EVM and WASM smart contracts and offers developers true interoperability, with cross-consensus messaging (XCM). Astar Network focuses on making the best smart contract platform so that dApps developers on Polkadot do not need to pay much attention to infrastructure and can focus more on their dApp.

### Refernces

This project won the second prize in the Polkadot Hackathon Latam 2022. As for that time, the smart contracts were only deployed in Moonbase Alpha. Now, the smart contracts are deployed also in Shibuya Testnet and Shiden Network in both Solidity and WebAssembly (Ink!).
